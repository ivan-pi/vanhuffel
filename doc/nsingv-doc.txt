   INTEGER FUNCTION : NSINGV

 1 PURPOSE:

   The function NSINGV computes the number of singular values of the
   bidiagonal matrix:

             !Q(1) E(2)  .    ...    0  !
             ! 0   Q(2) E(3)         .  !
         J = !                       .  !                        (1)
             !                      E(K)!
             ! 0   ...           0  Q(K)!

   which are <= THETA + TOL1, for given bound THETA and tolerance TOL1.

 2 SPECIFICATION:

   INTEGER FUNCTION NSINGV(Q, E, K, THETA, TOL1, TOL2)
   INTEGER K
   DOUBLE PRECISION Q(K), E(K), THETA, TOL1, TOL2

 3 ARGUMENT LIST:

   3.1 ARGUMENTS IN

       Q - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION (K).
           Contains the diagonal entries of the bidiagonal matrix J.

       E - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION (K).
           E(2),..., E(K) contains the superdiagonal entries of the
           bidiagonal matrix J.

       K - INTEGER.
           Dimension of the bidiagonal matrix J.

       THETA - DOUBLE PRECISION.
           Given bound.

   3.4 TOLERANCES

       TOL1 - DOUBLE PRECISION.
           This parameter specifies that all singular values S(i) of J
           satisfying !S(i) - THETA! <= TOL1 are considered to be equal
           to THETA.

       TOL2 - DOUBLE PRECISION.
           This parameter specifies that Q(i) and/or E(i), which are <=
           TOL2 in absolute value, are considered to be zero.

 6 METHOD DESCRIPTION:

   The computation of the number of singular values S(i) of J which
   are <= THETA is based on applying Sylvester's Law of Inertia, or
   equivalently, Sturm sequences [1,p.52] to unreduced symmetric
   tridiagonal matrices associated with J.
   Let T be the following symmetric matrix associated with J:

              ! 0   J'!
         T =  !       !
              ! J   0 !

   The eigenvalues of T are the singular values of J and their
   negatives [4]. Then by permuting the rows and columns of T into
   the order 1, K+1, 2, K+2,..., K, 2K it follows that T is orthogonally
   similar to the tridiagonal matrix T" with zeros on its diagonal and
   Q(1), E(2), Q(2), E(3), ..., E(K), Q(K) on its offdiagonals [3,4].
   If all Q(i) and all E(i) are nonzero, Sylvester's Law of Inertia
   may be applied to T".
   If one or more Q(i) or E(i) are zero, then T" is block diagonal and
   each diagonal block (which is then unreduced) must be analyzed
   separately by applying Sylvester's Law of Inertia.

 8 NUMERICAL ASPECTS:

   S(i) could also be obtained with the use of the symmetric tridiagonal
   matrix T = J'J, whose eigenvalues are the squared singular values
   of J [4,p.213]. However, the method actually used is more accurate,
   see [2], and equally efficient.

   With respect to the accuracy the following holds, see [2]:
   - if the established value is denoted by S then at least S singular
     values of J are <= THETA/(1 - (3K-1.5)EPS) and no more than S
     singular values are <= THETA x (1 - (6K-2)EPS)/(1 - (3K-1.5)EPS),
     where EPS is the machine precision.
